Linear Interceptor changelog

2017-05-15
	- Created Fortran project for Linear Interceptor. Created readme, changelog, and todo_list files.
	- Added functions to convert from degrees to radians and from radians to degrees.
	- Main now calculates the speed and angle of a projectile.
	
2017-05-18
	- Main now calculates the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) components of the projectile's speed.
	
2017-05-19
	- Main now calculates the angle and speed an intercepting projectile should be fired at in order to intercept an incoming projectile at a given time.
	
2017-05-20
	- Added comments to code. Reorganized for better readability.
	- Added calculations for time to intercept and projectile speed based on angle.
		- Added required variables to make these calculations
		- Added projectile and interceptor slope calculations.
		- Added projectile y-intercept calculations.
	- Added branch structure to choose which data about the interceptor is known: time to intercept, angle, or interceptor speed.
	- Added output formatting.
	
2017-05-22
	- Added elapsed time calculations and additional constants for "given interceptor speed" calculations.
	- Added requirement for d/2a > 0; if it is less than 0, the interceptor is not fast enough to reach the projectile.
	- Fixed mathematic errors in code.
	
2017-05-23
	- Added loop to ask for user input before calculations.
	
2017-05-29
	- Added read/write statements to get user input for incoming projectile properties.
	
2017-05-31
	- Turns out I'm a fool and forgot to add a way for the user input the time between incoming projectile measurements. This has been added now.
