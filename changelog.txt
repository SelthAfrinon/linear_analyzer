	- Added comments to code. Reorganized for better readability.
	- Added calculations for time to intercept and projectile speed based on angle.
		- Added required variables to make these calculations
		- Added projectile and interceptor slope calculations.
		- Added projectile y-intercept calculations.
	- Added branch structure to choose which data about the interceptor is known: time to intercept, angle, or interceptor speed.
	- Added output formatting.
